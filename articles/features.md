# So many features, so many browsers
At this moment, there are like 7.4 billion people on earth (Worldbank, 2017). Around 3.4 billion of them have access to the internet on a daily base (Internet Live Stats, 2017). These 3.4 billion internet users are browsing the web using 11 well known browsers. Not only desktop computers and laptops, but tablets and smartphones as well (Can I Use).

The fact that there are so many ways to access the internet for a big amount of people means that there is a lot to take into account as a web developer. Does your code support all the browsers? How does it look on mobile and tablet?

## Responsive design
Responsive design is one of the most heard words in web development these days. Not so many years ago we only had desktop computers and some people owned a laptop. We, the developers, only had to develop and design our websites for these devices (Daalderop, 2013). But since the technology got better and more devices were made, we suddenly had to change our way of working. Now there are screens in all sorts of sizes. In 2016 Google announced that 60% of all search queries came from smartphones (Sterling, 2016). This is the reason lots of developers are designing and coding for mobiles first. Because the screens are not that big, the mobile first approach comes in very handy. Taking that in mind you are sure that the most important content is shown in the right way. If you work the other way around, ‘desktop first’, you’ll probably have to much content to work with on a small screen.

## Browsers
Nowadays there are 11 well known browsers. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera are the best known and most used browsers. When building a project, you have to take all of them into account. Different browsers support different features is a different way. For example; inline SVG is not supported by all versions of Internet Explorer. For those browsers you need to think of a logical fall-back, replacing it with a png image for example. There are different tools on the web where you can check if something is supported in different browsers. The best known and widely used tool for that is Can I Use.

## Progressive enhancement
One good way to make sure your website works on all browsers and devices is to use the principle of progressive enhancement. It means that you start designing and coding your website in the simplest way possible. A website with just some HTML and well supported CSS. From there on you start adding features, like JavaScript enhancements. The website will look better with these enhancements, and it can be easier to use. But without them, when browsing with an older browser, the most important parts of the website will still be working.

## Conclusion
The web is changing in a high tempo. New techniques and principles have to be used for the best experience, and even to make it possible at all to visit your website. But with some good research and checks whether functionalities are well supported or not, and keeping in mind that a lot of your visitors use a smartphone or other device, your website will be accessible for all these 3.4 billion people!
