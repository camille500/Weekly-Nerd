# The living devices, the web of things
Technology is developing faster than we could ever expect. It’s not that long ago that we met the internet. For me it’s hard to imagine a life without Google. But it isn’t so long ago that the multinational tech gig was invented. In the year of 1998 Sergey Brin and Larry Page aired the search engine all of us used someday. It was a competitor of Yahoo, a widely used search engine at that time. But times change, company’s come and go. But technology will always improve. Exponential it is.

## The web
When I was younger, around my 8th birthday, the internet was super new. Calling and surfing the web at the same time was almost impossible. The prices were a lot higher as well, you paid for each minute you used the internet. Right now you get unlimited gigabytes with a speed that wasn’t even imaginable back then.
So, it’s clear the internet evolved from a simple way to share information for a high price, to a widely used technology we can’t even think out of our lives.

The possibilities are growing each day. We connect not only our computers to the internet, but all of our household and other devices as well. By securing a constant communication between for example our phone and our fridge, we have much more control than ever before.

## The Internet of Things (IOT)
That the internet is not only there for computers and smartphones is clear. But I didn’t go over all the other possibilities we have. I did mention the 'smart fridge', but there is so much more. These days many people have wearables like a smartwatch. All these connected devices are part of what is called the Internet of Things. The name says what it is, things connected to the internet. But do we get happier with all these connected devices? I don’t know. The big multinationals and companies do. They are able to collect lots of data about you and the environment your living in. Data about your whereabouts, hearth rate, people around you and a lot more. Data that is worth a lot of money.

## Big data
All the IOT devices we have together collect a lot of data. So, for example: Apple’s smartwatch tracks your location, heart rate, messages you receive, you average walking speed and a lot more. This data about you specific isn’t interesting for them, but for you it can be. You can track your hearth rate when sporting, sleeping, et cetera. But now comes the Big data part; Apple collects this data from tens of thousands of people. Putting all this data together makes it much more interesting. Now they can start to look for patterns. When I talk about patterns think about; male people in the age between 20 and 29 who sleep an average of 6 hours a night. What is their average hearth rate? Are there signs that can tell that a stroke is coming? There are so many patterns in such a big database full of data.

## Conclusion
The technology gets better and better every day. With new smart devices invented almost everyday companies hope to better our life’s, to make it all a bit easier.
But never forget; those companies have other goals as well. Maybe one of the most profitable products they sell is your data. So be aware of what data you give away, and what smart devices you put in your house, or on your wrist.
