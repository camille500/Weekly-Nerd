# Why you should(n’t) use JavaScript frameworks
JavaScript is an awesome programming language with a lot of possibilities. In the last years a lot of frameworks where created that make it even more easy to build websites using JavaScript. But is it a good thing to use them? What are the pro’s and what are the con’s? You’ll see them here!

## Why you should use them
Let’s start with the positive part of this article. The reasons why JavaScript frameworks are great to use.

### Time
JavaScript frameworks are often used by many people. A lot of the one’s available today are open source projects where people worked on for months or even years. That means that the code offers you a lot of useful functions and it consists out of stable, well tested code. Before you start your project, half the work is done already.

### Documentation
It can be hard to find the right solution for a specific problem. When writing in Vanilla JavaScript, you’ll almost never find a solution that can help you solve the problem you’re facing instantly. That’s because you’re probably the first one solving it. But if there is a framework that can help you with the problem, there is a great documentation most of the time. This will help you finish your project faster than when you have to write and learn to understand all the code yourself.

### Security
When you start to build your application, you’re not so worried about the security of the whole in the beginning. After finishing the last pieces, you might start testing and finding a lot of security leaks. The good thing about frameworks; they are well tested and thus well secured. No need to worry about that anymore!

### Open source
Developers like to help each other out. On the web, there are a lot of open source projects where people collaborate on a framework or library. Let’s say you are using a framework that just misses this one feature that would be great to implement. No problem! Clone the repository, create a branch, implement your great idea, push it and wait for it to be part of the master project. You are happy and the whole community can now use your implementation! Awesome, right?

## Why you shouldn’t use them
Now we’ve had the positive points, let’s get to the reasons why frameworks aren’t as great as you thought.

### Lack of knowledge
Frameworks are pre-build pieces of JavaScript you can use in your projects. The problem is, you’re not writing the code yourself. You learn to use the framework, but lack of knowledge what’s behind it. The thing is; you can write it in Vanilla JavaScript yourself. What if the framework isn’t supported anymore? How are you going to fix the problems you’ll face? You can only do that with good knowledge of the language! Try to build as much as you can and only use framework when it’s really necessary.

### To many frameworks
There are thousands and thousands of JavaScript frameworks available. For almost all problems there is a one to solve it. But how good it may sound, it can be a really bad thing. Every year new frameworks can be used solving the same problem. Many websites for example where using Google’s AngularJS, but then there was Facebook’s ReactJS. And believe me, next year there will be a new thing. If your boss always wants the new thing... Yeah then you’ll have a lot more unnecessary work in the coming years. So just build your own solution!

### Limitations
A framework is great to quickly start your project. But what if you’ve been building on a project for many hours, finding out that your framework has limitations that makes it impossible to finish it? That’s not cool at all! Okay, it’s open source most of the time. But it can take months before your code will be implemented in the new version, if it even will!

## Conclusion
Frameworks have their pro’s and con’s. I think the most important thing for a developer is to understand the under-laying principles and logics of a framework. A great developer should be able to build the framework himself. Okay, when in a hurry you can always use one. But be careful which one you’ll pick!
