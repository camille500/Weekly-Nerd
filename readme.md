## Notes
These are a small resume's of the weekly nerd sessions

### 1. Stephen Hay - Week 1
Stephen Hay is a developer at Catawiki. His talk was about UX and accessibility. He worked on the W3C guidelines and gave us some tips for a better overall user experience.

- When building a website, check the W3C guidelines
- Make your own guidelines when working in a team so that everyone is on the same line.
- Don't be afraid to try out new things and technologies
- Always keep the design problem in mind when building your product.
- Design lo-fi prototypes as long as you can, and **test them a lot***
- Make sketches before you build something

### 2. Peter Paul Koch - Week 3
Peter Paul Koch gave an very interesting weekly nerd about some problems he notices on the web.

* **To many features**
  * We want to add to many features so our app feels like a native one. That's bad practice.
* We use **to many frameworks**
* Not all developers have enough knowledge, they have no idea how to solve a problem.
* Our web applications can't get better than native app's, accept it.
* Using to many features -> We lose the overal view.

#### Polyfills
Polyfills help us to make sure that all features work in different browsers.

**The right way to focus**
1. Technology focus (what can it do)
2. Feature focus (what features can be added)
3. experience focus (how is the overall experience)

& .. Don't use to many tools!

### 3. Titus Wormer - Week 4

### 4. Jasper Moelker - Week 5
Jasper Moelker works at the Voorhoede, we visited him for a weekly nerd

- The basic experience of your application has to be enjoyable
- Make sure your not only developing for Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera.. There are more!
- Start with minimum requriments, make sure every one can use your application.
- Use feature detection to check what the actual browser supports, enhance if possible.
- Make sure your website works with HTML and CSS only, JavaScript can break!
- CSS can do things you probably do with JavaScript. Use the target selector!

### 5. Bram Duvigneau - Week 6
Bram is a blind developer, a really good one. It was a very interesting session! You can find my annotations below!

### 7. Niels Leenheer - Week 10
Niels is the owner of HTML5test.nl. He gave a interesting talk about the internet of things

- Made his house into a smart house
- The internet of things is boring, make it exciting!
- Everything can be connected, it matters how you do it.
- The 'S' in IOT stands for security
- Smart homes are the future

### 8. Leonie Wattson
Leonie is a blind developer as well. She gave a interesting talk about things we, developers, should know about screen readers.

- A screen reader translates text into speech. It's a software that can be used on almost every platform.
- Screen readers are not only there for the blind. They are there for the visually impaired, people driving a car and dyslectic for example.
- Developers want to build something that **everyone** is able to use. It's our responsibility.
- If your browser supports a new tag, that doesn't mean the screen reader does. Know your possibilities.
- Make elements on your project focusable.

### 9. Nick de Bruijn - Week 13
Nick de Bruijn is one of Lifely's founders. He talked about the process that involved starting your own company.
